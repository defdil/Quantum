# Quantum

My name is Defne Dilbaz and I am an undergraduate summer research intern for Summer 2019 in Prof. Alán Aspuru-Guzik's Matter Lab with CQIQC Summer Award. My research is about 0-π Qubit; a topologically protected qubit. 

As an Electrical and Computer Engineering student at the University of Toronto, I did not know quantum mechanics. With the help of Dr. Thi Ha Kyaw, who was my mentor, and Prof. Alán Aspuru-Guzik, I was able to learn quantum mechanics and run simulations.

This GitHub Repository contains simulations for general quantum processes: Hamiltonian evolution, population graphing, LC-oscillators. Also, I have included simulations of the 0-π Qubit.

	LZ-Effect: This is a problem set arranged by Dr. Thi Ha Kyaw which analyzes a time-independent Hamiltonian, it's population graph, and the evolution as defined by Schrodinger's equation.		
	Simulations:
		0-π potential: This is a simulation of the 0-π qubit potential Hamiltonian based on [1]
		LC-Oscillator: This is an energy spectrum graph of the LC-Oscillator. The energies of consecutive energy levels are evenly spaced.
		0-π qubit by Defne Dilbaz: This is the slideshow I presented for Undergraduate Summer Research Program organized by University of Toronto Computer Science Department.
